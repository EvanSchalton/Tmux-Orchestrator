# Immediate Blockers and Risks Assessment

## Critical Blockers

### 1. Working Directory Restrictions ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Issue**: Cannot cd to parent directories due to security restrictions
- **Impact**: Limited ability to run commands from project root
- **Workaround**: Use absolute paths or work from current directory
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Can work around but impacts efficiency

### 2. Multiple Active Agent Sessions üîÑ
- **Current State**:
  - test-restoration session: QA Engineer + PM already active
  - test_mcp_disabled-frontend session: 2 Frontend Devs active
- **Risk**: Conflicting work or resource contention
- **Recommendation**: Coordinate with existing agents or consolidate efforts

## Technical Risks

### 1. Test Coverage Gaps üìä
- **Risk**: Deleting 38 test files may remove valuable test scenarios
- **Current Coverage**: Unknown - need to run coverage analysis
- **Mitigation**: Archive tests before deletion, extract valuable scenarios

### 2. Modified Files Not Committed ‚ö°
- **Affected Files**:
  - Configuration files (.pre-commit-config.yaml, pytest.ini)
  - Active test files in tests/unit/mcp/
  - System status files
- **Risk**: Changes may conflict with test restoration work
- **Action Required**: Review changes before proceeding

### 3. Deprecated Architecture References üèóÔ∏è
- **Issue**: Tests reference non-existent `tmux_orchestrator.server.tools.*`
- **Scale**: 38 files with outdated imports
- **Complexity**: HIGH - Requires understanding both old and new architectures

## Process Risks

### 1. No Clear Ownership üë•
- **Issue**: Multiple agents working without clear coordination
- **Risk**: Duplicate effort or conflicting changes
- **Solution**: Establish clear ownership and communication channels

### 2. Uncommitted Analysis Files üìÑ
- **Files**:
  - DISABLED_MCP_TESTS_REPORT.md
  - DISABLED_TESTS_ANALYSIS.md
  - bandit_results.json
  - tests_backup_20250824_194040.tar.gz
- **Risk**: Important analysis may be lost
- **Action**: Decide whether to commit or clean up

## Environmental Concerns

### 1. Active Monitoring Daemon ‚öôÔ∏è
- **Status**: Monitor daemon running (PID: 1985/29793)
- **Impact**: May affect test execution timing
- **Note**: Messaging daemon not running

### 2. System Status Updates üîÑ
- **Observation**: status.json continuously updating
- **Impact**: May cause merge conflicts if committed
- **Recommendation**: Add to .gitignore if not already

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Coordinate with Active Agents**
   - Check with QA Engineer in test-restoration:2
   - Verify Frontend Dev work in test_mcp_disabled-frontend

2. **Review Modified Files**
   - Examine changes to pytest.ini
   - Check pre-commit configuration changes
   - Review test file modifications

3. **Establish Working Agreement**
   - Define roles and responsibilities
   - Set up communication protocol
   - Agree on commit strategy

4. **Create Safety Backup**
   - Ensure test backup is complete
   - Document current state
   - Prepare rollback plan

## Risk Mitigation Priority

1. **HIGH**: Archive tests before deletion
2. **HIGH**: Coordinate with active agents
3. **MEDIUM**: Review and handle uncommitted changes
4. **MEDIUM**: Establish clear project ownership
5. **LOW**: Address working directory restrictions

## Recommendation

Before proceeding with test restoration:
1. Sync with active QA Engineer and Frontend Devs
2. Review all uncommitted changes
3. Create comprehensive backup
4. Establish clear communication channels
5. Define success criteria and rollback procedures
