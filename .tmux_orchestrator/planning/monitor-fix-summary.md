# Monitor Fix Project Summary

## Completed Work

### 1. ✅ Monitor Auto-Submit Feature Implemented
- Fixed the critical bug where monitor detected idle agents but didn't submit
- Added logic to send Enter key when detecting "idle with Claude interface"
- Implemented safeguards:
  - Submission attempt tracking
  - 30-second cooldown between attempts
  - Reset after 10 attempts to prevent overflow
  - Proper error handling

### 2. ✅ PM Context Updated for Resource Cleanup
- Added cleanup responsibilities to PM role
- PMs now know to kill agents when work is complete
- Prevents wasting monitoring cycles on completed work

## Evidence of Success

The monitor logs show the feature working:
```
Agent monitor-fix:2 is idle with Claude interface
Auto-submitting stuck message for monitor-fix:2 (attempt #1)
First auto-submit attempt for monitor-fix:2
```

## Current Status

The monitor-fix team appears to have completed their main work:
- PM (window 2): Idle, received update about cleanup
- Developer (window 3): Idle for extended period
- QA (window 4): Idle for extended period

## Recommended Actions

1. **PM should assess if work is complete** and clean up team:
   ```bash
   tmux-orc agent kill monitor-fix:3  # Developer
   tmux-orc agent kill monitor-fix:4  # QA
   ```

2. **Orchestrator should verify** the fix is working in production

3. **Next priority issues** from feedback:
   - Session attach command
   - Agent discovery fixes
   - Bulk agent commands

## Lessons Learned

1. **Dogfooding works** - Using tmux-orchestrator to fix itself is effective
2. **Auto-submit is critical** - Without it, agents get stuck indefinitely
3. **Resource cleanup is important** - Idle agents waste monitoring resources
4. **PM context needs cleanup guidance** - Now included in context
