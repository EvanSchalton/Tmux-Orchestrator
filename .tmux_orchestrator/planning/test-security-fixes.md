# Security Test Plan - Command Injection Fixes

## Test Objective
Validate that the security fixes for command injection vulnerabilities are properly implemented and all tests pass.

## Current Status
- Modified test file: `tests/security/test_command_injection_fixes.py`
- Tests have been updated to work with MockTMUXManager
- Need to verify all security tests pass

## Test Procedures

### 1. Run Security Tests
Execute the security test suite to validate command injection fixes:
```bash
pytest tests/security/test_command_injection_fixes.py -v
```

### 2. Pre-commit Validation
Run pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### 3. Full Test Suite
Run complete test suite to ensure no regressions:
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Expected Results
- All security tests should pass
- No command injection vulnerabilities should be present
- Input sanitization should be working correctly
- Pre-commit hooks should pass

## Team Requirements
- QA Engineer: Execute security tests and validate fixes
- Code Reviewer: Verify security implementation
- PM: Coordinate testing efforts

## Recovery Instructions
If tests fail:
1. Review test output for specific failures
2. Check MockTMUXManager implementation
3. Verify subprocess calls are properly mocked
4. Ensure input sanitization is working
