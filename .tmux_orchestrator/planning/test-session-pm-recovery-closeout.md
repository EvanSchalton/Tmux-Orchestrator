# Project Closeout Report - PM Recovery and Session Management

## Recovery Summary
**Date**: 2025-08-26
**Session**: test-session
**PM**: Claude (test-session:3) - Recovered PM
**Agent**: Claude-test-dev (test-session:2) - QA Engineer
**Status**: SESSION MANAGEMENT COMPLETE ✅

## Recovery Actions Completed
✅ **PM Context Restoration**: Successfully loaded PM context and responsibilities
✅ **Session Assessment**: Identified test-session with 3 windows (shell, QA agent, PM)
✅ **Project Status Review**: Confirmed previous security validation project completed
✅ **Agent Briefing**: Provided context and role briefing to idle QA agent
✅ **Team Coordination**: Restored communication with test-session:2 agent

## Findings
- **Previous Project**: Security test validation completed successfully (commit 1c46155)
- **Agent Status**: Claude-test-dev was idle and available for new tasks
- **Session State**: No active project plans requiring continuation
- **Monitoring**: Daemon properly detected PM failure and initiated recovery

## Recovery Effectiveness
1. **Communication Restored**: MCP agent messaging working correctly
2. **Context Rehydration**: PM role context successfully loaded
3. **Agent Coordination**: QA agent briefed and ready for assignment
4. **Daemon Integration**: Monitoring system functioned as designed

## Session Decision
Since the previous security validation project was completed and no new project plan exists for this session, the appropriate action is session termination per PM protocol.

## Technical Notes
- **MCP Tools**: Functioning correctly for agent communication
- **Session Windows**: 3 windows maintained (shell:1, qa:2, pm:3)
- **Recovery Time**: PM recovered successfully within monitoring thresholds
- **Agent State**: QA agent maintained idle state appropriately

## Final Actions
1. **Agent Notification**: QA agent briefed on session status
2. **Documentation**: Recovery process documented for future reference
3. **Session Cleanup**: Preparing for proper session termination
