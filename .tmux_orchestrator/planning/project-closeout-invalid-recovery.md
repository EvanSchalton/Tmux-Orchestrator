# Project Closeout - Invalid Session Recovery

**Date**: 2025-08-25T03:08:00
**Session**: invalid
**PM**: claude-pm (Window 2)
**Project Type**: Recovery Assessment

## Summary

This PM was spawned after a daemon-detected PM failure and recovery (attempt 3/3). Upon recovery assessment, no active project context or team members were found in the "invalid" session.

## Recovery Assessment Results

### Environment Status
- ✅ Monitoring daemon healthy (PID: 37517)
- ✅ Session active: invalid
- ✅ PM operational in window 2
- ❌ No team members found in session
- ❌ No project plan or context discovered

### Other Active Work
- Identified active test-related projects in other sessions
- tmux-orc-test-1756091246 session has QA Engineer and PM working
- Test audit and MCP restoration plans exist but are not associated with this session

### Actions Taken
1. Verified daemon and monitoring status
2. Checked session and agent status
3. Searched for project plans and context
4. Reviewed blockers and immediate tasks
5. Determined no actionable work exists

## Conclusion

No project work to coordinate in this session. The "invalid" session appears to be a recovery test or orphaned session with no active project. Per PM protocols, initiating proper shutdown.

## Recommendations
- Monitor recovery mechanisms to prevent orphaned PMs
- Consider adding project context validation to PM spawn process
- Review why "invalid" session was created without project context
