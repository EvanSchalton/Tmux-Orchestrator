## Usage Guidelines for Orchestrators

### When Creating Custom Agents:

1. **Start with Project Context**: What specific challenges does this project face?
2. **Combine Relevant Patterns**: Mix and match elements from multiple examples
3. **Add Unique Constraints**: Include project-specific requirements and limitations
4. **Define Success Metrics**: How will this agent's effectiveness be measured?
5. **Consider Team Dynamics**: How will this agent interact with others?

### Example Custom Agent Creation:

```
Project: Real-time trading platform
Base Patterns: FinTech Specialist (#16) + Performance Engineer (#4) + DevOps (#9)

Custom Briefing:
"You are a High-Frequency Trading Developer combining financial expertise, 
performance optimization, and infrastructure reliability. Your code must 
execute trades in microseconds while maintaining financial compliance and 
system stability. Every millisecond of latency costs money."

Unique Constraints:
- Sub-millisecond latency requirements
- Financial regulatory compliance (MiFID II, Dodd-Frank)
- 99.99% uptime SLA
- Real-time risk management integration
```

### Innovation Encouragement

Remember: These examples are launching points, not destinations. The most effective agents often:

- **Combine unexpected patterns** (e.g., UX Researcher + Security Engineer for privacy-focused user research)
- **Add domain-specific expertise** (e.g., Medical Device Developer with FDA compliance knowledge)
- **Adapt to team dynamics** (e.g., Senior Developer who mentors junior team members)
- **Solve unique problems** (e.g., Legacy System Modernization Specialist)

The future of agent orchestration lies in creative adaptation and innovative combinations that serve specific project needs. Use these patterns as inspiration, but always tailor to your unique context.

## Evolution and Learning

As you use these patterns, document:
- Which combinations work well together
- What adaptations were most successful
- Which patterns needed significant modification
- Novel patterns that emerged from project needs

This knowledge feeds back into the orchestration system, making future agent creation even more effective and contextually aware.
