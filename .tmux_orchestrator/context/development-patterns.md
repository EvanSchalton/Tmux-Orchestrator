# Development Patterns

## File Operations
- **CREATE** files when single-responsibility principle requires it
- **One business logic function/class per file** (e.g., `create_user.py`, `validate_email.py`)
- **PREFER** editing existing files over creating new ones when appropriate
- **AVOID** creating documentation files unless explicitly requested by user
- **ALWAYS** use absolute paths in file references

## Additional Project Patterns
[Project-specific patterns can be added here]
