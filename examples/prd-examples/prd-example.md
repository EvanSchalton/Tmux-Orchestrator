# Product Requirements Document: Task Management API

## Overview
A RESTful API for managing tasks with user authentication, designed to support a modern task management application.

## User Stories

### Authentication
- As a user, I want to register with email and password
- As a user, I want to log in securely
- As a user, I want to reset my password if forgotten

### Task Management
- As a user, I want to create tasks with title and description
- As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- As a user, I want to edit and delete my tasks
- As a user, I want to see only my own tasks

## Functional Requirements

### Authentication Endpoints
- POST /api/auth/register
- POST /api/auth/login
- POST /api/auth/logout
- POST /api/auth/reset-password

### Task Endpoints
- GET /api/tasks (list user's tasks)
- POST /api/tasks (create task)
- GET /api/tasks/{id} (get specific task)
- PUT /api/tasks/{id} (update task)
- DELETE /api/tasks/{id} (delete task)

### Data Models

**User Model:**
- id: UUID
- email: string (unique)
- password_hash: string
- created_at: timestamp
- updated_at: timestamp

**Task Model:**
- id: UUID
- user_id: UUID (foreign key)
- title: string (required)
- description: text
- completed: boolean (default false)
- created_at: timestamp
- updated_at: timestamp

## Technical Requirements

### Backend
- Python with FastAPI framework
- PostgreSQL database
- JWT authentication
- Alembic for migrations
- Pydantic for validation

### Security
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- JWT tokens with expiration
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization

### Testing
- Unit tests with pytest
- Integration tests for all endpoints
- 90% code coverage minimum
- Authentication test scenarios

## Quality Standards
- All tests must pass
- No linting errors (ruff)
- Type checking must pass (mypy)
- API documentation with OpenAPI
- Proper error handling with status codes

## Success Criteria
1. All endpoints functioning correctly
2. Authentication is secure and tested
3. Data validation prevents invalid inputs
4. API documentation is complete
5. 90%+ test coverage achieved

## Out of Scope
- Frontend application
- Email sending functionality
- Social authentication
- Task sharing between users
- Mobile applications

## Timeline
Estimated: 2-3 days with 5-agent team
