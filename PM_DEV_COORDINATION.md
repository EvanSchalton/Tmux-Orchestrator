# PM-Developer Coordination File

## Team Status
- **PM**: Active in daemon-fix-fullstack:2 - Has completed research and analysis
- **Developer**: Active in daemon-fix-fullstack:3 - Ready to implement solutions

## PM's Analysis Summary
The PM has identified that all 5 current submission methods fail:
1. Standard Enter key
2. Paste buffer method
3. Literal keys with C-m
4. Multiple Enter variations
5. Escape sequences with newlines

## Developer Tasks (Priority Order)

### 1. Terminal Automation Research
- Investigate using `expect` or `pexpect` for terminal automation
- Test if Claude requires mouse events or window focus states
- Try terminal recording/playback tools to capture working sequences
- Check if we need to simulate human typing speed

### 2. Debug Current Implementation
- Add detailed logging to capture terminal state
- Record raw escape sequences during manual submission
- Compare manual vs programmatic sequences
- Check `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/tmux_orchestrator/utils/claude_interface.py`

### 3. Alternative Approaches
- Research Claude API endpoints for terminal sessions
- Implement file-based message queue as fallback
- Test clipboard automation (xclip, pbcopy)
- Consider using xdotool or similar GUI automation

### 4. Quick Test Script
Create a test script that:
```bash
# Test different submission methods
tmux send-keys -t session:window "test message"
tmux send-keys -t session:window C-m
# Add timing, escape sequences, etc.
```

## File-Based Communication Protocol
Since messages can't be submitted:
- PM writes updates to: `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/PM_STATUS.md`
- Dev writes updates to: `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/DEV_STATUS.md`
- Shared findings in: `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/FINDINGS.md`

## Critical Files to Review
1. `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/tmux_orchestrator/utils/claude_interface.py`
2. `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/tmux_orchestrator/utils/tmux.py`
3. `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/CRITICAL_FIXES_v2.1.6.md`

## Success Criteria
- Find a method that reliably submits messages to Claude
- Implement and test the solution
- Verify monitoring daemon can notify PMs
- Confirm agent recovery works

**DEVELOPER**: Please read this file and begin investigating the terminal automation issue. Write your findings to DEV_STATUS.md
