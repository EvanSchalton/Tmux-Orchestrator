## Usage Tips

1. **Customize for Your Project**: These examples are starting points. Always tailor the briefing to your specific project needs.

2. **Combine Roles**: Agents can have multiple specializations. For example, a "Full-Stack Developer" might combine frontend and backend expertise.

3. **Adjust Detail Level**: Add more specific technical requirements, tools, or methodologies based on your project.

4. **Include Project Context**: Always provide project-specific context in the briefing, such as:
   - Tech stack being used
   - Existing codebase conventions
   - Team communication preferences
   - Specific quality standards

5. **Update as Needed**: Agent briefings can be updated as the project evolves. Use the recovery system to re-brief agents when needed.

## Examples of Spawning Custom Agents

```bash
# Simple spawn with role template
tmux-orc agent spawn my-developer orchestrator:2 --role developer

# Spawn with custom briefing file
tmux-orc agent spawn my-pm orchestrator:5 --briefing-file ./briefings/pm-briefing.md

# Spawn with inline custom briefing
tmux-orc agent spawn my-qa orchestrator:4 --briefing "You are a QA specialist focusing on API testing..."

# Spawn with working directory
tmux-orc agent spawn frontend-dev orchestrator:3 --working-dir ./frontend --role frontend

# Spawn into specific session/window with full customization
tmux-orc agent spawn security-expert security-project:2 \
  --briefing "You are a security expert..." \
  --working-dir ./security-audit
```

Remember: The orchestrator (Claude) will always create custom agents based on the specific needs of your project. These templates are meant to inspire and guide, not constrain!
