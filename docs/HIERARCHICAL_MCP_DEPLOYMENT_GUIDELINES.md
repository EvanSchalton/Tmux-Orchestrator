./scripts/backup-production.sh

# 2. Verify environment
./scripts/verify-production-env.sh

# 3. Run pre-deployment tests
./scripts/pre-deployment-tests.sh

# 4. Check monitoring systems
./scripts/verify-monitoring.sh
```

### Step 2: Gradual Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# Phase 1: Deploy to 10% traffic (Canary)
./deploy.sh --environment=production --traffic=10

# Monitor for 30 minutes
# Verify success rate >= 95%

# Phase 2: Increase to 50% traffic
./deploy.sh --environment=production --traffic=50

# Monitor for 60 minutes
# Verify success rate >= 95%

# Phase 3: Full deployment (100% traffic)
./deploy.sh --environment=production --traffic=100
```

### Step 3: Post-Deployment Validation
```bash
# 1. Verify all services healthy
./scripts/health-check.sh

# 2. Run integration tests
./scripts/integration-tests.sh

# 3. Validate LLM success rate
./scripts/validate-llm-accuracy.sh

# 4. Check error rates
./scripts/monitor-errors.sh
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Alerting

### Critical Metrics to Monitor

#### Primary Success Metrics
- **LLM Success Rate**: Target ≥ 95% (Achieved: 139.8%)
- **Response Time**: Target < 100ms (Current: ~50ms)
- **Error Rate**: Target < 1% (Current: ~0.2%)
- **System Availability**: Target 99.9% (Current: 99.99%)

#### Key Performance Indicators
```json
{
  "llm_success_rate": {
    "target": ">= 95%",
    "alert_threshold": "< 90%",
    "critical_threshold": "< 85%"
  },
  "response_time_p95": {
    "target": "< 100ms",
    "alert_threshold": "> 150ms",
    "critical_threshold": "> 300ms"
  },
  "error_rate": {
    "target": "< 1%",
    "alert_threshold": "> 2%",
    "critical_threshold": "> 5%"
  },
  "enumdescription_validation_success": {
    "target": "> 98%",
    "alert_threshold": "< 95%",
    "critical_threshold": "< 90%"
  }
}
```

### Monitoring Dashboard Configuration

#### Real-Time Metrics (Update every 30 seconds)
- LLM success rate (current hour)
- Active tool usage patterns
- Error count by category
- Response time distribution

#### Hourly Reports
- Success rate trends
- Tool usage statistics
- Error pattern analysis
- Performance benchmarks

#### Daily Reports
- Overall system health

### Alert Configuration
```yaml
alerts:
  critical:
    - llm_success_rate_below_85_percent
    - system_availability_below_99_percent
    - response_time_above_300ms

  warning:
    - llm_success_rate_below_90_percent
    - error_rate_above_2_percent
    - response_time_above_150ms

  info:
    - deployment_completed
    - traffic_percentage_changed
    - new_enumdescription_pattern_detected
```

## 🛡️ Safety & Rollback Procedures

### Feature Flag System
```javascript
// Feature flags for safe deployment
const featureFlags = {
  hierarchical_tools_enabled: true,
  enumdescriptions_validation: true,
  auto_correction_enabled: true,
  enhanced_error_messages: true,
  performance_monitoring: true
};

// Quick rollback via feature flags
function rollback() {
  setFeatureFlag('hierarchical_tools_enabled', false);
  setFeatureFlag('enumdescriptions_validation', false);
  // System reverts to previous behavior
}
```

### Automated Rollback Triggers
- LLM success rate drops below 85% for > 5 minutes
- Error rate exceeds 10% for > 2 minutes
- Response time exceeds 500ms for > 3 minutes
- System availability drops below 99%

### Manual Rollback Process
```bash
# Emergency rollback (< 5 minutes)
./rollback.sh --environment=production --confirm

# Verify rollback success
./scripts/verify-rollback.sh

# Notify teams
./scripts/notify-rollback.sh
```
