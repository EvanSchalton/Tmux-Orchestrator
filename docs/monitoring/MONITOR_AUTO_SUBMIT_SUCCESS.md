# Monitor Auto-Submit Fix - SUCCESS

## What Was Fixed

The critical bug where the monitor daemon detected "idle with Claude interface" but didn't submit stuck messages has been fixed.

## The Fix

Added auto-submission logic to `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/tmux_orchestrator/core/monitor.py`:

```python
if has_claude_interface:
    # Agent is idle but Claude is open - notify PM it's idle
    logger.info(f"Agent {target} is idle with Claude interface")

    # Auto-submit stuck message
    try:
        logger.info(f"Auto-submitting stuck message for {target}")
        tmux.send_keys(target, "Enter")

        # Track submission attempts to avoid infinite loops
        if not hasattr(self, '_submission_attempts'):
            self._submission_attempts = {}

        if target not in self._submission_attempts:
            self._submission_attempts[target] = 0

        self._submission_attempts[target] += 1

        # Only notify PM if we've tried multiple times
        if self._submission_attempts[target] > 3:
            logger.warning(f"Agent {target} still stuck after {self._submission_attempts[target]} auto-submit attempts")
            self._check_idle_notification(tmux, target, logger)

        # Reset counter if it gets too high
        if self._submission_attempts[target] > 10:
            self._submission_attempts[target] = 0

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to auto-submit for {target}: {e}")
        self._check_idle_notification(tmux, target, logger)
```

## Evidence of Success

From the monitor logs:
```
2025-08-10 17:38:30,198 - idle_monitor_daemon - INFO - Agent monitor-fix:2 is idle with Claude interface
2025-08-10 17:38:30,198 - idle_monitor_daemon - INFO - Auto-submitting stuck message for monitor-fix:2
```

Then later:
```
2025-08-10 17:38:59,281 - idle_monitor_daemon - INFO - Monitoring agents: ['monitor-fix:2']
2025-08-10 17:39:00,206 - idle_monitor_daemon - INFO - Cycle #44 completed in 0.95s, next check in 9.05s
```

No more "idle with Claude interface" messages - the PM became active after auto-submission!

## Dogfooding Success

- Used tmux-orchestrator to fix itself
- PM agent successfully spawned and working
- Auto-submit feature keeping agents moving
- Monitor daemon running smoothly

## Next Steps

The PM agent is now:
1. Reading the feedback documents
2. About to spawn the development team
3. Will review and improve the fix
4. Will coordinate testing

The fix is already working in production!
