## Outstanding Features Review

The documentation review revealed the following features and work areas are well-documented:

1. **Monitoring System**: Comprehensive monitoring features with enhanced rate limit handling
2. **Recovery System**: Robust agent recovery with auto-restart capabilities
3. **Security Hardening**: Multiple security improvements and vulnerability fixes
4. **Daemon Self-Healing**: Advanced daemon recovery and monitoring capabilities
5. **PM Recovery**: Enhanced PM crash detection and recovery mechanisms

All critical features appear to be implemented based on the documentation review. The cleanup improves repository organization without losing any important information.
