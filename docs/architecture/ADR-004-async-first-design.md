# ADR-004: Async-First Architecture Design

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The original monitor.py used synchronous operations, limiting scalability. With teams growing to 50+ agents, we need concurrent monitoring capabilities while maintaining reliability.

## Decision
Adopt an async-first architecture with these principles:

### 1. Async Core Components
- All I/O operations are async by default
- Sync wrappers for backward compatibility
- Connection pooling for resource management

### 2. Concurrency Control
```python
# Semaphore-controlled concurrent operations
semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrent)
async with semaphore:
    result = await monitor_agent(agent)
```

### 3. Resource Management
- TMux connection pooling
- Automatic connection recycling
- Circuit breakers for fault tolerance

### 4. Performance Patterns
- Batch processing for efficiency
- Multi-level caching
- Timeout management
- Retry logic with exponential backoff

## Architecture Components

### AsyncMonitorService
- Orchestrates async components
- Manages plugin strategies
- Provides performance metrics

### TMuxConnectionPool
```python
async with pool.acquire() as tmux:
    content = await tmux.capture_pane_async(target)
```

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
```python
@circuit_breaker(failure_threshold=5)
async def health_check(target: str) -> bool:
    # Protected operation
```

## Performance Targets
- 50+ agents monitored concurrently
- <1s monitoring cycle for 20 agents
- <5s monitoring cycle for 100 agents
- Graceful degradation under load

## Consequences

### Positive
- 10x performance improvement potential
- Better resource utilization
- Fault tolerance built-in
- Scalable to large deployments

### Negative
- Increased complexity
- Async/await learning curve
- Debugging challenges
- Python 3.7+ requirement

## Migration Strategy
1. Async components in parallel with sync
2. Feature flags control adoption
3. Performance comparison validation
4. Gradual migration of user base
