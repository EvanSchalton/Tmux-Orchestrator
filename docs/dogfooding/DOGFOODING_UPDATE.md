# Dogfooding Update - Progress Report

## Good News!
We successfully have 3 Claude agents running:
1. **Tmux-Orchestrator-backend:2** (Claude-pm) - Backend PM agent
2. **daemon-fix-fullstack:2** (Project-Manager) - Fullstack PM agent
3. **daemon-fix-fullstack:3** (Frontend-Developer) - Developer agent

All agents have Claude running and are showing the Claude interface.

## Current Status
- ✅ Agent deployment DOES work - Claude is launching properly
- ✅ We have active PM agents ready to work on the daemon fix
- ❌ Monitoring daemon not detecting agents (bug in discovery logic)
- ❌ Messages still can't be submitted programmatically

## Active Agents Analysis

### daemon-fix-fullstack:2 (Project-Manager)
This PM has already:
- Analyzed the message delivery problem
- Identified key issues with terminal automation
- Proposed solutions including:
  - Deploy developer to investigate terminal automation tools
  - Implement file-based messaging as temporary workaround
  - Contact Claude/Anthropic support for terminal automation guidance

### Next Steps
1. The PM is waiting to deploy a developer (but can't due to message submission issue)
2. We need to manually coordinate between agents using file-based communication
3. Fix the monitoring daemon's agent discovery logic

## The Chicken-and-Egg Problem
We're trying to use tmux-orchestrator to fix tmux-orchestrator's message delivery issue, but:
- PMs can't deploy new agents (requires message submission)
- Agents can't coordinate (requires message submission)
- Monitoring can't notify PMs (requires message submission)

## Workaround Strategy
Since the PMs are active and have analyzed the problem, we should:
1. Use file-based communication between agents
2. Have agents write status/plans to files
3. Manually check agent progress
4. Focus on fixing the core message submission issue first
