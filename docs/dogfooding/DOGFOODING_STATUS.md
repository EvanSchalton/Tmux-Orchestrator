# Tmux-Orchestrator Dogfooding Status Report

## Attempt Summary
We attempted to use tmux-orchestrator to fix its own critical issues, specifically the message delivery bug that prevents agent coordination.

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Agent Deployment Not Launching Claude
- **Problem**: When deploying agents via `tmux-orc agent deploy` or `tmux-orc team deploy`, the windows are created but Claude is not launched
- **Evidence**: Windows show bash prompt instead of Claude interface
- **Impact**: Agents cannot function without Claude running

### 2. Monitoring Daemon Not Detecting Agents
- **Problem**: Even with active sessions, monitoring reports "0 agents found"
- **Root Cause**: Agent detection looks for Claude indicators in window content
- **Since Claude isn't running**: No agents are detected

### 3. Message Delivery Still Broken
- **Confirmed**: Messages appear in input box but don't submit
- **Warning**: "Claude message submission uncertain" appears for all send attempts
- **This is the core issue** we're trying to fix

## Current State
1. Created PRD: `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/planning/prd-fix-daemon-messaging.md`
2. Created task list: `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/planning/tasks-fix-daemon-messaging.md`
3. Created urgent briefing: `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/URGENT_PM_BRIEFING.md`
4. Deployed agents but they're not functional (no Claude)
5. Monitoring daemon running but detecting 0 agents

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Fix agent deployment** to properly launch Claude in tmux windows
2. **Then retry dogfooding** with properly deployed agents
3. **Manual workaround**: Open Claude manually in the deployed windows

### Alternative Approach
Since dogfooding is blocked by the deployment issue, we should:
1. Fix the deployment script to properly launch Claude
2. Or manually fix the message delivery issue without dogfooding
3. Then use the fixed system to address remaining issues

## Key Insight
The tmux-orchestrator has multiple cascading failures:
1. Agent deployment doesn't launch Claude
2. Without Claude, monitoring can't detect agents
3. Without message delivery, agents can't coordinate
4. Without coordination, the PM-driven workflow fails

We need to fix the foundational issue (agent deployment) before dogfooding can work.
