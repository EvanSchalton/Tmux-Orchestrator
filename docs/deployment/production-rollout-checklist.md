- [ ] Full deployment window secured

#### Deployment Steps
1. [ ] Enable for all users
   ```bash
   export TMUX_ORCHESTRATOR_USE_MODULAR_MONITOR=true
   ```

2. [ ] Monitor full deployment
3. [ ] Verify system stability

#### Validation (24 hours)
- [ ] All sessions migrated successfully
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Stability maintained
- [ ] User satisfaction confirmed

## Smoke Tests

### Basic Functionality
Run these tests after each phase:

```bash
# Agent discovery
tmux-orc monitor test-discovery

# Idle detection
tmux-orc monitor test-idle-detection

# Notification delivery
tmux-orc monitor test-notifications

# PM recovery
tmux-orc monitor test-pm-recovery

# Performance benchmark
python tests/benchmarks/monitoring_performance.py --quick
```

Expected results:
- [ ] All agents discovered (100% success rate)
- [ ] Idle detection accurate (>95% accuracy)
- [ ] Notifications delivered (100% delivery rate)
- [ ] PM recovery functional (<30s recovery time)
- [ ] Performance targets met (see benchmarks)

## Load Testing

### Pre-Production Load Test
