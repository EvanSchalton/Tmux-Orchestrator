# Critical False Positive PM Crash Detection Fix - IMPLEMENTED

**Date**: 2025-08-16
**Developer**: Claude Code
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

## Overview

Implemented the critical fix for false positive PM crash detection as specified in the status report at `.tmux_orchestrator/planning/2025-08-15T22-30-00-daemon-recovery-improvements/status-report.md` lines 94-109.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Context-Aware Pattern Matching

**File**: `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/tmux_orchestrator/core/monitor.py`

#### A. Regex Pattern Implementation (Lines 1707-1730)
As recommended in the status report, implemented regex-based pattern matching:

```python
regex_ignore_contexts = [
    r"test.*failed",
    r"tests?\s+failed",
    r"check.*failed",
    r"Tests failed:",
    r"Build failed:",
    r"unit\s+test.*failed",
    r"integration\s+test.*failed",
    r"test\s+suite.*failed",
    r"failing\s+test",
    r"deployment.*failed",
    r"pipeline.*failed",
    r"job.*failed",
    r"Task failed:",
    r"Failed:",
    r"FAILED:",
    r"\d+\s+tests?\s+failed",  # "3 tests failed"
    r"failed\s+\d+\s+tests?",   # "failed 3 tests"
]

# Check regex patterns for more flexible matching
for pattern in regex_ignore_contexts:
    if re.search(pattern, content, re.IGNORECASE):
        return True
```

#### B. Pre-Kill Confirmation (Lines 1899-1932)
Implemented 30-second observation period with multiple confirmation requirement:

```python
# Require 3 observations within 30-second window before declaring crash
if observation_count < 3:
    logger.info(
        f"PM crash indicator '{found_indicator}' observed ({observation_count}/3) "
        f"in {pm_window} - monitoring for {self._crash_observation_window}s"
    )
    return (False, pm_window)  # Don't declare crash yet
```

### 2. Additional Improvements

#### A. Reduced False Positive Triggers (Lines 1860-1882)
- Removed overly broad indicators: "failed", "error:", "exception:"
- Focused on actual process crashes: "segmentation fault", "core dumped"
- Retained process termination indicators

#### B. Shell Prompt Detection (Lines 1794-1819)
- Checks for shell prompts at end of content (actual crashes)
- Patterns: "bash-5.1$", "zsh:", standalone "$", "%", "#"
- Takes precedence over other patterns

#### C. Active Conversation Detection (Lines 1802-1820)
- Detects active Claude patterns: "Human:", "Assistant:", "I'll", "Let me"
- Recognizes PM activity: "tmux-orc", "Running", "Checking", "Executing"

### 3. Test Coverage

**File**: `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/tests/test_context_aware_crash_detection.py`

Added comprehensive test coverage including:
- `test_ignore_regex_patterns` - Validates regex pattern matching
- 11 test cases total, all passing
- Covers both false positive prevention and actual crash detection

## Results

### Before Fix:
- PMs killed every ~30 seconds when "failed" appeared in output
- System unusable with monitoring enabled
- Had to run with `tmux-orc monitor stop` as workaround

### After Fix:
- Context-aware detection prevents false positives
- Regex patterns handle variations like "3 tests failed", "check failed"
- 30-second observation period prevents premature kills
- Requires 3 observations before declaring crash
- Shell prompt detection ensures actual crashes are still caught

## Validation

All tests passing:
```
tests/test_context_aware_crash_detection.py ........... [100%]
============================= 11 passed in 10.03s ==============================
```

## Configuration

- Observation window: 30 seconds (hardcoded)
- Required observations: 3 before declaring crash
- Grace period after recovery: 3 minutes (configurable via `monitoring.pm_recovery_grace_period_minutes`)

## Next Steps

The critical false positive fix is complete and ready for production use. The monitoring system can now be safely enabled without killing healthy PMs.
