# Implementation Summary

## Tasks Completed

### 1. ✅ Urgent Compaction Detection Fix
**Issue**: Monitor incorrectly marked agents as idle during compaction due to missing detection of compaction symbols.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive list of compaction symbols: ✻, ✽, ✢, ✶, ✿, ❋, ◉
- Added processing words: Elucidating, Musing, Moseying, Frolicking, Channelling, Ruminating, Contemplating
- Added detection for any activity symbol + ellipsis pattern (e.g., "✻ Elucidating…")

**Files Modified**:
- `tmux_orchestrator/core/monitor.py` (lines 476-509)

### 2. ✅ Rate Limit Implementation
**Feature**: Automatic detection and recovery from Claude API rate limits.

**Implementation**:
- Added `RATE_LIMITED` state to AgentState enum
- Created `extract_rate_limit_reset_time()` function to parse reset times
- Created `calculate_sleep_duration()` function with 2-minute safety buffer
- Modified monitoring loop to detect rate limits and pause until reset
- Added PM notifications before and after rate limit periods

**Files Modified**:
- `tmux_orchestrator/core/monitor_helpers.py` (added functions at lines 357-417)
- `tmux_orchestrator/core/monitor.py` (rate limit detection at lines 300-350)

**Tests Added**:
- `tests/test_rate_limit.py` - 14 comprehensive tests for all edge cases
- `tests/test_monitor_daemon_resume.py` - 4 tests for daemon resume behavior

### 3. ✅ Pre-commit Validation
All quality gates are passing:
- ✅ ruff-format
- ✅ ruff
- ✅ mypy
- ✅ bandit
- ✅ All other pre-commit hooks

### 4. ✅ Documentation
Created comprehensive documentation:
- `docs/rate-limit-handling.md` - Complete guide to rate limit feature

## Key Features

### Compaction Detection
- Detects all Claude compaction animations
- Prevents false "idle" alerts during conversation compaction
- Works with any combination of activity symbol + ellipsis

### Rate Limit Handling
- Automatic detection of Claude rate limit errors
- Extracts reset time from error message
- Calculates appropriate sleep duration
- Pauses entire monitoring daemon
- Resumes automatically after rate limit reset
- Notifies PM before and after pause

## Testing
- 18 total tests added
- All tests passing
- Edge cases covered:
  - Invalid time formats
  - Timezone handling
  - Midnight crossings
  - Daemon resume behavior
  - PM notification flow

## Production Ready
The implementation is production-ready with:
- Robust error handling
- Comprehensive logging
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Automatic feature activation (no configuration needed)
- Safety buffers to prevent premature resumption
