# Fixture Consolidation Update

## Progress Report

Backend Dev has begun implementing the fixture optimization recommendation from the Phase 3 Quality Report by consolidating commonly used fixtures into `conftest.py`.

## Fixtures Consolidated ✅

### 1. Mock Fixtures
```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_tmux() -> Mock:
    """Create a mock TMUXManager for testing."""
    return MagicMock(spec=TMUXManager)

@pytest.fixture
def logger() -> Mock:
    """Create a mock logger for testing."""
    return MagicMock(spec=logging.Logger)
```

### 2. CLI Testing
```python
@pytest.fixture
def runner() -> CliRunner:
    """Create Click test runner."""
    return CliRunner()
```

### 3. File Fixtures
```python
@pytest.fixture
def temp_activity_file() -> Generator[Path, None, None]:
    """Create a temporary activity file for testing."""
    # Proper cleanup implemented

@pytest.fixture
def temp_schedule_file() -> Generator[Path, None, None]:
    """Create a temporary schedule file for testing."""
    # Proper cleanup implemented

@pytest.fixture
def temp_orchestrator_dir() -> Generator[Path, None, None]:
    """Create temporary orchestrator directory."""
    # Uses tempfile.TemporaryDirectory
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Reduced Duplication**: These fixtures were duplicated across 20+ test files
2. **Type Safety**: All consolidated fixtures have proper type hints
3. **Consistent Behavior**: Single source of truth for mock behavior
4. **Improved Maintenance**: Updates in one place affect all tests

## Next Steps

1. **Remove Local Duplicates**: Delete local versions of these fixtures from individual test files
2. **Update Imports**: Ensure test files use the centralized fixtures
3. **Add More Common Fixtures**: Identify other frequently duplicated fixtures

## Quality Improvements

- ✅ All fixtures properly typed
- ✅ Comprehensive docstrings added
- ✅ Proper cleanup implemented for file fixtures
- ✅ Clear organization with section comments

This consolidation directly addresses the fixture optimization recommendation from the Phase 3 report and represents another significant quality improvement.
