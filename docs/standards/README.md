# CLI Enhancement Standards

## Overview
This directory contains comprehensive standards and guidelines for CLI enhancement development in the Tmux Orchestrator project. These standards ensure maintainable, secure, and high-quality CLI code that integrates seamlessly with the MCP tool generation system.

## Standards Documents

### 1. [CLI Coding Standards](./cli-coding-standards.md)
**Purpose**: Establishes coding standards for the CLI reflection architecture
**Key Topics**:
- Core architecture principles
- Command structure standards
- JSON output standardization
- Input validation requirements
- Error handling patterns
- Performance standards
- Testing requirements

**Use When**: Developing any new CLI command or modifying existing ones

### 2. [CLI Security Best Practices](./cli-security-best-practices.md)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive security guidelines for CLI enhancements
**Key Topics**:
- Security threat model
- Input validation security
- Command execution security
- Output sanitization
- Resource protection
- MCP security considerations
- Audit and logging
- Security testing requirements

**Use When**: Implementing security features, conducting code reviews, or performing security assessments

### 3. [MCP Tool Integration Requirements](./mcp-tool-integration-requirements.md)
**Purpose**: Quality requirements for MCP tool integration via CLI reflection
**Key Topics**:
- Automatic tool generation standards
- CLI command documentation requirements
- JSON output compatibility
- MCP server quality standards
- Integration testing requirements
- Quality metrics and monitoring
- Deployment and configuration standards

**Use When**: Ensuring CLI commands are compatible with MCP tool generation or optimizing MCP integration

## Quick Reference Guide

### For New CLI Commands
1. **Review** [CLI Coding Standards](./cli-coding-standards.md) for structure requirements
2. **Implement** security validations per [Security Best Practices](./cli-security-best-practices.md)
3. **Ensure** MCP compatibility per [MCP Integration Requirements](./mcp-tool-integration-requirements.md)
4. **Test** using the testing frameworks defined in the standards

### For Code Reviews
1. **Check** adherence to coding standards
2. **Validate** security implementations
3. **Verify** MCP tool generation compatibility
4. **Confirm** test coverage meets requirements

### For Security Assessments
1. **Use** the security threat model from best practices guide
2. **Apply** input validation security standards
3. **Review** output sanitization implementations
4. **Validate** audit logging compliance

## Architecture Context

These standards support the **CLI Reflection Architecture** where:
- **CLI commands are the single source of truth**
- **MCP tools are automatically generated from CLI**
- **No dual implementation maintenance required**
- **Security and quality are built into the foundation**

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Regular Reviews
- **Quarterly**: Review standards for relevance and completeness
- **After major releases**: Update standards based on lessons learned
- **When new threats emerge**: Update security best practices
- **When MCP protocol changes**: Update integration requirements

### Standards Updates
1. **Propose changes** via pull request with justification
2. **Review impact** on existing implementations
3. **Update documentation** and examples
4. **Communicate changes** to development team
5. **Plan migration** for existing code if needed
