# Repository Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive repository cleanup performed to improve organization, maintainability, and user experience.

## Major Changes

### 1. Documentation Reorganization
All documentation has been moved to the `docs/` directory with logical subdirectories:

- `docs/setup/` - Installation and quickstart guides
- `docs/workflows/` - End-to-end workflows and PRD process
- `docs/features/` - Feature documentation (team composition, coordination, etc.)
- `docs/development/` - Architecture, contributing guidelines, and learnings
- `docs/legacy/` - Deprecated files kept for reference
- `docs/templates/` - Template files (install scripts, etc.)

### 2. Script Consolidation
All utility scripts have been moved to the `scripts/` directory:

- Essential scripts: `send-claude-message.sh`, `schedule_with_note.sh`, `idle-monitor-daemon.sh`
- Utility scripts: `package.sh`, `setup-devcontainer.sh`, `test-bootstrap.sh`
- Python utilities: `tmux_utils.py`
- Test runner: `run-tests.sh`

### 3. Directory Structure
- Removed legacy `.tmux-orchestrator/` (with hyphen)
- Kept active `.tmux_orchestrator/` (with underscore) for task management
- Consolidated `Examples/` and `examples/` into single `examples/` directory
- Created proper subdirectories for examples:
  - `examples/screenshots/`
  - `examples/prd-examples/`
  - `examples/team-compositions/`

### 4. Root Directory Cleanup
The root directory now contains only essential files:

- **Core Files**: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
- **Installation**: `bootstrap.sh`, `install.sh`
- **Python Project**: `pyproject.toml`, `poetry.lock`, `pytest.ini`, `requirements-test.txt`
- **Templates**: `devcontainer-template.json`
- **Configuration**: `.gitignore`

### 5. Removed Files
- Temporary files: `CLEANUP_ANALYSIS.md`, `next_check_note.txt`
- Broken symlinks: Various monitoring and PM scripts
- Deprecated files: Old shell scripts replaced by CLI commands
- Duplicates: Consolidated duplicate documentation and examples

### 6. CLI Command Migration
Replaced shell scripts with CLI commands:

| Old Script | New CLI Command |
|------------|-----------------|
| `commands/deploy-agent.sh` | `tmux-orc agent deploy` |
| `commands/agent-status.sh` | `tmux-orc agent status` |
| `commands/list-agents.sh` | `tmux-orc list` |
| `commands/start-orchestrator.sh` | `tmux-orc orchestrator start` |
| `commands/recover-agents.sh` | `tmux-orc recovery check` |

### 7. Test Suite Addition
Added comprehensive test coverage:

- Unit tests for all CLI commands
- MCP server tests with async support
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Coverage reporting and linting

### 8. Documentation Updates
- Added proper attribution to original Tmux-Orchestrator project
- Created migration guide for users upgrading
- Updated README to highlight v2.0 features (dynamic teams, task management)
- Removed redundant architecture diagram (replaced by PRD workflow)

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Structure**: No more confusion between duplicate directories
2. **Better Organization**: Logical grouping of files by purpose
3. **Easier Navigation**: Users can find what they need quickly
4. **Modern Workflow**: CLI-based instead of scattered shell scripts
5. **Professional Appearance**: Clean root directory with only essentials
6. **Maintainability**: Clear separation between core files and utilities
