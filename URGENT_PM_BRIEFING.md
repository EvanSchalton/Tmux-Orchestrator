# URGENT PM BRIEFING - Critical System Fix Required

## Immediate Action Required

The tmux-orchestrator system has a critical bug that breaks all agent coordination and recovery features. Your mission is to fix this immediately.

## The Problem

Messages sent to Claude agents via tmux appear in the input box but are NEVER submitted. This means:
- Monitoring daemon can't notify you of issues
- Recovery daemon can't restart crashed agents
- Agents can't communicate with each other
- The entire orchestration system is broken

## Your Mission

1. **Read the PRD**: `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/planning/prd-fix-daemon-messaging.md`
2. **Review task list**: `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/planning/tasks-fix-daemon-messaging.md`
3. **Coordinate with the Frontend-Developer** to implement the fix
4. **Focus on Research First** - We need to figure out how to programmatically submit messages to Claude

## Key Files to Review

1. `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/tmux_orchestrator/utils/claude_interface.py` - Current submission attempts
2. `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/tmux_orchestrator/utils/tmux.py` - TMUXManager implementation
3. `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/CRITICAL_FIXES_v2.1.6.md` - Previous fix attempts

## Critical Path

1. Research how to submit messages to Claude programmatically
2. Test different key sequences and methods
3. Implement a working solution
4. Verify it works with the monitoring daemon
5. Test full recovery cycle

This is blocking ALL autonomous features of tmux-orchestrator. Please prioritize this above all else.

## Communication Note

Since inter-agent messaging is broken, use file-based communication:
- Write status updates to `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/PM_STATUS.md`
- Have the developer write updates to `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/DEV_STATUS.md`
