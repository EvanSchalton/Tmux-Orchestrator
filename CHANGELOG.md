**IMPORTANT**: All users should update immediately. See security advisory for mitigation steps if unable to update.

## Version 2.1.24 - Context-Aware Crash Detection

### 🎯 Major Feature
- **Context-Aware PM Crash Detection**: Implemented intelligent crash detection that understands conversation context
  - Prevents false positives when PMs discuss errors, failures, or issues
  - Detects Claude UI presence before declaring a crash
  - Adds 3-minute grace period after PM recovery
  - Commit: 381bf99

### 🔧 Fixed
- **Critical**: Resolved false positive PM kills when "failed" keyword appears in normal conversation
- **Impact**: System is now stable with monitoring enabled

### 📚 Documentation
- Added `/docs/monitoring/context-aware-crash-detection.md` with usage guide
- Updated CLAUDE.md with daemon recovery status

## Version 2.1.14 - Monitoring System Improvements

### 🔧 Fixed

#### Critical Fix: False Positive Crash Detection
- **Resolved**: False positive crash detection when agents type "@" symbol in their prompts
- **Root Cause**: The "@" symbol was incorrectly included in bash prompt detection patterns
- **Impact**: Prevented unnecessary agent restarts and PM notifications

#### Major Improvement: Simplified Auto-Submit
- **Changed**: Auto-submit mechanism from complex key sequences (C-a, C-e, Enter) to single Enter key
- **Benefits**: More reliable message submission, reduced complexity, better compatibility
- **Implementation**: Updated to use new `tmux.press_enter()` method

### 🏗️ Refactoring

#### Monitor Module Restructuring
- **New Module**: Created `monitor_helpers.py` with extracted helper functions
- **Test Coverage**: Achieved 91% test coverage on helper functions
- **Functions Extracted**:
  - `is_claude_interface_present()`: Detects active Claude UI
  - `detect_agent_state()`: Determines agent state from terminal content
  - `has_unsubmitted_message()`: Checks for pending messages
  - `should_notify_pm()`: PM notification logic with cooldowns

#### Updated tmux Integration
- **Methods**: Replaced `send_keys()` with `send_text()` and `press_enter()`
- **Literal Flag**: Added support for tmux literal flag to prevent key interpretation
- **Reliability**: Improved text sending accuracy and special character handling

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed crash detection logic to prioritize Claude UI indicators before checking bash prompts
- Removed "@" symbol from bash prompt indicators list
- Enhanced idle agent detection with more accurate state tracking
- Fixed false positives from terminal content analysis

### ⚠️ Known Issues
- False positive crash detection still occurs when "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions" appears in agent terminal
- Monitor may attempt to restart agents that are actively working if the command text appears in their visible terminal content
- Workaround: The system checks for Claude UI indicators first, reducing but not eliminating false positives

### 📊 Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite for monitor helpers
- Added fixtures for various agent states
- Improved test isolation and reliability
- 12 test failures remain in auto-recovery and auto-submit tests (under investigation)

## Version 2.0.0 - Enhanced Agent Communication & VS Code Integration

### 🎉 Major Enhancements

#### Agent Communication System
- **Enhanced tmux-message**: Auto-submit messages with proper Enter keypress
- **Agent Coordination**: PM and Orchestrator now have full inter-agent communication commands
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time agent status checking and monitoring
- **Team Check-ins**: PM can conduct off-cycle status checks with all agents

#### VS Code Integration
- **Individual Agent Tasks**: Open any agent in a new VS Code terminal

#### Stability & Reliability
- **Fixed Window Indexing**: All scripts use consistent :1 window references for tmux base-index 1
- **Claude Environment**: Proper TERM, venv activation, and Node.js warnings suppression
- **Crash Prevention**: Removed tmux queries that caused server crashes
- **Auto-Recovery**: Better error handling and graceful degradation

### 🤖 New Commands
