# PM Status Update - Critical Message Delivery Bug

## Current Status: BLOCKED - Terminal Interface Issue

### Investigation Results:
Frontend Developer has completed extensive research and testing:

1. **Problem Confirmed**: Messages appear in Claude's input box but do not submit
2. **Root Cause**: Claude's terminal interface uses a custom TUI that doesn't respond to standard key sequences
3. **Testing Completed**: Tried 15+ different key combinations including Ctrl+Enter, various Enter types, function keys, etc.

### Key Finding:
Claude's interface shows:
```
╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ > [message appears here]                                                     │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

But no programmatic key sequence successfully submits the message.

### Immediate Recommendation:

**IMPLEMENT FILE-BASED MESSAGING WORKAROUND**

Since the terminal interface automation is proving difficult, we should implement a file-based communication system:

1. **Monitoring daemon writes**: `/tmp/agent_notifications/[agent_id].txt`
2. **Agents poll for files**: Check every 30 seconds for new messages
3. **Process and delete**: Agents read, process, and remove files

This bypasses the terminal interface entirely and provides reliable message delivery.

### Alternative Long-term Solutions:
1. Switch to Claude API instead of terminal interface
2. Implement WebSocket bridge
3. Use expect/pexpect for more advanced terminal automation

### Urgent Request:
Should I proceed with implementing the file-based messaging system as an immediate workaround? This would restore monitoring/recovery functionality while we research the terminal interface issue.

**This is still blocking all autonomous features.**
