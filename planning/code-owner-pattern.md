We should add a "use-code-owners" flag to the CLI (not sure which commands, help me with that).

When we want to scale the team horizontally (e.g. more than one engineer working on the same part of the stack) we should have them use git subtrees and have another "code-owner" agent that's responsible for merging code and maintaining functionality and code quality.
