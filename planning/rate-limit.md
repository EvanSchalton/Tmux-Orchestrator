One failure we haven't accounted for is the "Claude usage limit reached. Your limit will reset at 4am (UTC)." -- when this happens I think the daemon should alert the PM with a message that specifically tells the PM to kill the daemon and run a bash command that starts it up again once the time has passed. This will allow the team to automatically start working again once the rate limit has subsided
