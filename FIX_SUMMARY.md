# Send Message Fix Summary

## Problem
The `TMUXManager.send_message()` method was failing to submit messages to Claude agents, causing the monitoring daemon to be unable to communicate with PMs and other agents.

## Root Cause
The original implementation had unnecessary Claude readiness checks and was not following the proven working sequence from the CLI implementation.

## Solution
Updated `TMUXManager.send_message()` in `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/tmux_orchestrator/utils/tmux.py` to match the exact working sequence from the CLI agent send command:

1. Press Ctrl+C to clear any existing input
2. Press Ctrl+U to clear the input line
3. Send the message text as literal
4. Wait max(delay * 6, 3.0) seconds
5. Press Enter to submit

## Key Changes
- Removed Claude readiness check that was causing delays
- Simplified to match proven CLI implementation
- Added configurable delay parameter
- Uses regular Enter key (not Ctrl+Enter)

## Verification
- Created test scripts that confirm messages are being sent successfully
- Daemon can now communicate with agents
- All test cases pass including special characters and long messages

## Files Modified
- `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/tmux_orchestrator/utils/tmux.py` - Updated send_message() method

## Status
âœ… FIXED - The messaging system is now working correctly.
