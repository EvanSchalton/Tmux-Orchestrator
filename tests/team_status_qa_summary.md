# Team Status Bug Fix - QA Summary Report

## Executive Summary
The team status bug fix has a critical implementation error that prevents the command from running. Once this is corrected, the approach looks correct for solving the original false positive issue.

## Critical Issue Found
- **NameError**: `_is_actual_error` function is undefined when called
- **Root Cause**: Function defined after usage (line 192 vs line 179)
- **Impact**: Team status command completely broken with Python traceback

## Original Bug Verification
- **Confirmed**: Healthy agents incorrectly shown as "Error"
- **Example**: QA Engineer at status-bug-fix:3 shown as Error despite being healthy
- **Cross-check**: `agent info` confirms agent is active and healthy

## Fix Approach Analysis
The fix correctly addresses the root cause by:
1. Removing naive "error" keyword matching
2. Adding sophisticated pattern matching for real errors
3. Distinguishing between discussing errors vs experiencing errors

## Test Coverage Created
1. **Test Plan**: `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/tests/team_status_test_plan.md`
2. **Test Results**: `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/tests/team_status_test_results.md`
3. **Verification Script**: `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/tests/verify_team_status_fix.py`

## Recommendations
1. **Immediate**: Move `_is_actual_error` function before line 142
2. **Testing**: Run verification script after fix
3. **Future**: Add unit tests to prevent function ordering issues

## Test Status
- ✅ Test cases created
- ✅ Bug identified and documented
- ❌ Full test suite blocked by NameError
- ⏳ Awaiting fix implementation

Once the function ordering is corrected, the fix should resolve the false positive issue while maintaining real error detection.
