"""
Rate Limit Regression Testing Suite

Tests the complete rate limit workflow to prevent regression of the critical
sleep-based pause functionality. Validates end-to-end rate limit handling.

Key Issue: Exception handling in monitor.py:1955-1960 prevents time.sleep()
execution, causing session crashes instead of graceful rate limit handling.
