# Team Status Bug Fix Test Plan

## Bug Description
`tmux-orc team status` incorrectly shows healthy agents as 'Error'.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. All Healthy Agents
- Deploy a team with multiple healthy agents
- Verify team status shows all as healthy
- Cross-check with individual agent status commands

### 2. Mixed Health States
- Deploy team with some healthy and some problematic agents
- Verify accurate representation of each agent's state
- Ensure no false positives/negatives

### 3. Empty Teams
- Test status command with no agents deployed
- Verify graceful handling and appropriate messaging

### 4. Killed Agents
- Deploy team, kill some agents
- Verify status correctly shows killed agents
- Test recovery detection

### 5. Compacting Agents
- Test during agent memory compaction
- Verify compacting agents not shown as errors
- Check status after compaction completes

### 6. Edge Cases
- Very large teams (10+ agents)
- Rapid status checks during agent state changes
- Concurrent team operations

## Success Criteria
1. Team status accurately reflects actual agent health
2. No false error reports for healthy agents
3. Real errors are still properly detected
4. Status aligns with individual agent info/status commands
5. Performance remains acceptable (<1s response time)

## Test Results

### Test Run 1: Initial State Check
