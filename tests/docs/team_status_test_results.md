# Team Status Bug Fix Test Results

## Test Environment
- Date: 2025-08-23
- Tester: QA Engineer (status-bug-fix:3)
- Version: Current main branch with partial fix applied

## Bug Summary
`tmux-orc team status` incorrectly shows healthy agents as 'Error'.

## Critical Finding: Implementation Error

### Issue 1: NameError in team status command
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Command completely broken
**Error**: `NameError: name '_is_actual_error' is not defined`
**Location**: `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/tmux_orchestrator/core/team_operations/get_team_status.py:179`
**Cause**: Function `_is_actual_error` is called on line 179 but defined later on line 192. Python requires functions to be defined before use.

```python
# Line 179: Function called here
elif _is_actual_error(pane_content):

# Line 192: Function defined here
def _is_actual_error(pane_content: str) -> bool:
```

**Impact**: Team status command crashes with traceback, making it completely unusable.

## Test Results

### Test 1: All Healthy Agents
**Status**: BLOCKED by NameError
**Command**: `tmux-orc team deploy frontend 3 --project-name test-healthy-team`
**Result**: Team deployed successfully, but status check failed with NameError

### Test 2: Existing Team Status Check
**Status**: FAILED
**Command**: `tmux-orc team status status-bug-fix`
**Expected**: Show QA Engineer as healthy/idle
**Actual**: Shows QA Engineer as "Error" (before crash fix)

### Test 3: Individual Agent Status Cross-Check
**Status**: PASSED
**Command**: `tmux-orc agent info status-bug-fix:3`
**Result**: Shows agent as active and healthy - confirms team status has false positive

## Root Cause Analysis

The original bug was that team status was using simple keyword matching for "error", causing false positives when agents discussed errors in their work. The fix attempted to add a more sophisticated `_is_actual_error` function with specific patterns, but:

1. The function was placed after its usage, causing NameError
2. The fix approach is correct - using regex patterns to detect actual errors vs discussions about errors

## Fix Verification Status

### What Was Fixed (Attempted)
- Removed simple "error" keyword matching that caused false positives
- Added sophisticated error detection with specific patterns
- Improved detection logic to differentiate real errors from error discussions

### What Still Needs Fixing
1. Move `_is_actual_error` function definition before its usage
2. Test the complete fix after addressing the NameError
3. Verify all test scenarios pass

## Next Steps
1. Backend developer needs to move the `_is_actual_error` function before line 142
2. Re-run all test scenarios after fix
3. Add unit tests to prevent regression
