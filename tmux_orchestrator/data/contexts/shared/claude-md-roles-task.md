When starting work, verify that `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/CLAUDE.md` contains a ROLES section that references the appropriate context files:

```markdown
# ROLES

If you are filling one of these roles, please adhere to these instructions.

## Project Manager (PM)

Read: `/workspaces/Tmux-Orchestrator/tmux_orchestrator/data/contexts/pm.md`
