PM DETECTION TEST SUMMARY
========================

✅ PM Detection Logic: WORKING CORRECTLY
   - Window "Claude-pm" at critical-fixes:1 is correctly identified as PM
   - _find_pm_in_session() returns the correct target
   - _is_pm_agent() properly detects PM based on window name

✅ Message Delivery: WORKING
   - tmux send-keys commands execute successfully
   - Messages can be delivered to the PM window

✅ Current PM Status: ACTIVE AND AWARE
   - PM is already tracking the issue
   - Has added "Fresh Claude Detection" bug to Daemon Specialist's scope
   - Team is fully operational with expanded scope

CONCLUSION: The PM detection and notification system is functioning correctly.
The daemon logs showing attempts to send to "critical-fixes:1" indicate the
system is working as designed. The PM has already received notifications and
is actively managing the situation.

If notifications appear to be missing, check:
1. Daemon log timing - notifications may have been sent earlier
2. PM's message history - they may have already acted on notifications
3. Cooldown periods - daemon has 5-minute cooldowns between duplicate notifications
